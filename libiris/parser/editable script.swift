// TO DO: give some thought to both in-process and out-of-process APIs; a native editor would typically parse and edit a script in-process, serializing it for execution in a sandboxed subprocess

// TO DO: balance counting per line needs to pass forward both counts so that they are picked up from the last line reader (or perhaps store them as `.lineBreak(bringForward:[Form], carryForward:[Form])`) // problem: what about string quotes? think all parens and quotes need to go on these lists - it's up to the rebalancer to count the string quotes and thus decide which parens to ignore as being inside quoted text

// TO DO: making line readers polymorphic for String or Substring may improve parsing times when reading for execution only

        // TO DO: for each line, is it worth keeping a quick-access array of its double-quote (and double-angle-quote) indices? i.e. to reduce string literals (which are initially multiple [to-be-discarded] tokens bounded by two .stringDelimiter tokens, possibly with `""` escapes as well), we need to scan the whole program doing a balance count (and when we do that, we want to try to be intelligent about guessing if any DQs are missing, even if the final count is even [i.e. balanced], which we can do by seeing how well each line of 'code' between any two quotes can reduce; actually, we could probably use a simpler heuristic: sequences of three or more non-keyword words that do not contain any colons are not valid LP commands which strongly implies they belong inside a string/annotation literal)

        // TO DO: each line wants to know if it starts inside code, string literal, or annotation [including its nesting depth]; this info may change independent of the line itself when preceding lines are modified; in addition, each line probably wants to keep a summary of the code's nesting order+depth within parens/brackets/braces/block keywords, enabling imbalances to be quickly checked for and fixes proposed (bearing in mind that checks only need to be performed outward from newly inserted/deleted lines [i.e. if adjoining lines were correctly balanced before, any fresh imbalances are assumed to lie in or at edges of the edited section, with proposed fixers appearing in or at edges of that section [users can, of course, move those fixers inward or outward to encompass less or more code, with live non-destructive checking of how those moves affect balancing until the user approves/undos the edit]]); this suggests that lines array should contain a semi-mutable struct which encapsulates both the immutable Line and mutable balancing/editing info; alternatively, we might keep the edits in a separate data structure that can express multi-line information, increasing available information while decreasing the number of elements being iterated when analyzing that info (albeit more complex to implement); in theory we might even store all lines within such structures, allowing those structures to extend and divide themselves without having to track their Lines separately; it remains to be seen (a hybrid solution would be to make the lines array polymorphic for single Lines and grouped Chunks of lines, allowing sections of script the editor is confident are correct [either because they are unchanged since the last successful 'full parse' or because heuristics say they are highly consistent with code/non-code content and can pinch them off as 'presumed correct'])
