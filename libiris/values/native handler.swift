        // TO DO: how best to break strong refcycle if handler is stored into same scope? (obvious option is for set to compare scopes for equal identity; this won't protect against more convoluted cycles, but it's the most common case); also consider slot assignment if using entoli 'everything is a command' semantics, in which case stored values are a separate enum case to stored handlers
