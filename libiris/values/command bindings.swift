// conceptually a command is a right-associative unary operator with arbitrary name and fixed precedence, where operand is always a record (non-record values are coerced to single-field record upon evaluation); in practice, the current Command implementation is an atomic structure comprising a name and Array of fields, plus internal caching (while it could be implemented as a Command(Symbol,Record) struct, this does not lend itself to dynamic [run-time] optimization; the tradeoff is increased code complexity)


// TO DO: what about, say, interpolated strings? we don't provide a syntax for that in core punctuation, so can't be optimized at compile-time; should primitive handler definitions have the ability to supply a custom binding struct


// note that late binding and an immutable AST* do not lend themselves to compile-time optimzations such as constant folding (*unless AST nodes are explicitly wrapped in EditableValue, which is the sort of thing the code editor/debugger might want to do); the obvious way to perform AST transforms is to eval the AST against an alternate set of primitive libraries (e.g. this is probably how native->Swift cross-compilation will be done) - when parsing code for that purpose, the parser could use an alternate Value source that provides wrapped versions of some or all Value types [c.f. kiwi parser, caveat we'll need a ValueConstructorProtocol so that different sources can be swapped in]; thus code analysis is code evaluation, just with [class-based] Values that gather 'usage' information (no doubt it'll be much slower than a conventional optimizing compiler design, but has the advantage of being completely library-driven and -extensible, using the exact same library extension mechanisms that supply library-defined handlers and operator sugar in run-time use)

struct MemoizedStaticValue: Handler {
    // slot contains a non-handler value; the command still invokes `call()`, but no argument processing is performed, just evaluation+coercion of the value to the requested type if not already of that type
    
    var description: String { return "\(self.result)" }

        //return self.coercion.isa(coercion) ? self.result : try coercion.coerce(self.value, in: scope) // TO DO: if value is memoizable, what about caching results of eval, using coercion as cache key? e.g. if value is a non-constant expr, e.g. a block, it must be evaled every time, but if value.isMemoizable then there's no need to coerce every time [if the coercion succeeds, then it can cache and return that result every time; if coercion fails, then it can cache and rethrow that coercion error every time])

// TO DO: also DynamicallyBoundNonMaskableHandler? (this would capture Scope, avoiding full lookup every time); Q. is this still needed? late binding allows a command call to fail if handler isn't yet defined; once handler is defined, first call to Environment.get() will lift it to current scope to prevent subsequent masking (Q. what about non-environment scopes?) [note: where multiple parent scopes are persistent, the invoking scope can still end up binding handler from a different parent, depending on the order in which the parents populate the named slot - IOW there is something to be said for AppleScript's static slot definitions over Python/JS-style runtime slot insertions/deletions, which allow crazy runtime customizability at cost of static machine/human reasoning]
