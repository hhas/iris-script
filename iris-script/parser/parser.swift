Q. what if colon appears at end of line? (prob put token back on stack)

                // one problem with colon for bindings: `a of b: c` is visually confusing and should probably be disallowed, or at least discouraged (use `set a of b to c`; Q. what about `b.a: c`?); also consider colon bindings to be essentially static, i.e. LH operand is fixed at parse time
