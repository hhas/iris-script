struct UnpopToken: TokenReader { // analogous to pushing an existing/modified token back onto the head of the token stream
    
    // e.g. given the token-reader tuple `(Token(.letters, "a*b"), R)`, where the "*" operator is written without delimiting whitespace, an operator disambiguating reader might output -> `(Token(.letters, "a"), UnpopToken(.letters "*", UnpopToken(.letters "b", R)))`; in practice, we probably want the "*" token tagged as `.lexeme(L)` form where L provides a more specific description of this token, in this case, an infix operator of known precedence and associativity that maps to the corresponding handler in a known library; this added information enables the final bottom-up precedence-climbing parser to resolve operator exprs into a correctly nested Command(â€¦) [note that whereas earlier readers are single-line, the final reader needs to operate across all lines; need to give some thought as to how this is represented]
