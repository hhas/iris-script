// TO DO: should be ok with an extra `lexicalScope` slot that's assigned as needed (Q. how to weakref/strongref? we need to watch out for circular refs in backing stores: a handler defined in a context should maintain a weakref to that context; evaling `handler_name as handler` [closure] should return strongref'd copy that can be returned for use outside that context; storing that strongref'd copy back in same context should re-weakref it; anything more convoluted will probably just leak cycles refunless we have a GC to break those)
