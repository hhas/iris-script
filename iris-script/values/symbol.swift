// TO DO: need a better name than Symbol (ideally we want to talk about 'symbols' as syntax, not as semantics; e.g. `≠` is the Unicode symbol meaning 'not-equal', which stdlib defines as an infix operator for performing numerical comparisons); 'Hashtag' would avoid the immediate confusion, although 'hashtag' has its own common meaning which could mislead in other ways

    // if interning, need to make these inits private and provide public class method as constructor instead (one downside of this is that ExpressibleByStringLiteral will no longer be allowable, as the constructor needs to look for existing symbols in cache and return those when found; also need to decide what to use as keys - it may be an idea to move all state out of Symbol struct and store only an integer key - this'll reduce symbol comparisons to simple integer == test and eliminate string wrangling overheads; getting the label/description string will involve a cache hit each time, but that's a much less frequent operation than hash lookups and comparisons)
