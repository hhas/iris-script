// Values may implement accessor/mutator protocols, allowing attribute lookups; where mutator is implemented, consider how this interacts with struct's pass-by-value semantics (it is likely that mutable values will be implemented as class wrapper[s] around the original Value)

// scopes are always implemented as classes; these are always pass-by-reference, being common state shared by all dependents of a scope

// Q. to what extent should scripts be able to directly reference scopes? (e.g. `current_scope`, `global_scope`, `scope named NAME`) Q. libraries should all appear in global namespace under a common root, e.g. `XXXXX.com.example.mylib`; e.g. `use_library {com.example.mylib}` would merge the library's symbols into the global namespace [caveat: how do we deal with name collisions?]); think Frontier/Plan9 namespace
