// iris-script recapitulates sylvia-lang, which recapitulates entoli

// syntactically, the final language should be primarily word-based with the minimum punctuation necessary to ensure unambiguous parsing (for discussion purposes, assume a word is any single word, or multiple words separated by underscores, or operator symbol)

// “everything is a command”; there is no distinction between a “variable” and a command with zero arguments. Conceptually, `set foo to 3` is storing the value `3` in the environment's 'foo' slot as if it was simple closure: { ()->Value in return value } (where 'value' is 3). Thus `foo` will always operate as a command; similar to Ruby, there is no distinction between `foo` (name only) or `foo {}` (name + empty arguments record), as there is in Swift/Python/JavaScript/etc.

// all commands behave as right-associative prefix 'operators'; where the right operand may be omitted (in which case it is null). For practical purposes, the operand when given is always treated as a record of zero or more fields, where each field has a value and is optionally labeled. (A record is effectively a tuple/struct hybrid.)

// Q. to what extent could optimization be achieved by eval-ing script against meta-libraries? (i.e. libraries that define the same set of handler interfaces as standard libraries, but whose handlers perform transformations on the initial AST in order to yield a more efficient equivalent)

import Foundation


// Q. what about dead code detection? (e.g. given the script `1, 2, 3.`, `1` and `2` [being side-effectless] are no-ops, while `3` is only relevant if the evaluator is connected to an output console); flagging 'useless' or 'suspect' code may be most useful in parenthesized groups, e.g. `(1,2+3)` will discard the 1 and return 5, but `(foo,2+3)` will return 5 while also performing a potentially effectful `foo` command; being parenthesized, that expr could be buried deep in a much larger expr (while the same effect can be achieved if a `foo` handler is defined that returns its input parameter as output while also performing its side-effect, that requires an explicit definition of `foo` whereas a parenthesized expr sequence works with any existing handler)

// TO DO: how would lexer adapter for multiline strings/annotations work? (upon detecting opening quote, it would return a lexer (or lexer adapter?) that knows how to find the end of that quote [Q. what token would it return in meantime?]) challenge is how to carry that reader forward from end of one line to process next, and finally swap out the quote reader for the standard token reader when done (TBH, it may not be worth the effort when parsing for editing; while slower, having everything tokenized regardless of whether it's code or quoted text gives the auto3cs lots more data to analyze, particularly when best-guessing where missing quotes/closing braces should appear)


script = "‘foo’ -1*-2+a3" // note that `a3` is two tokens: <.letters "a"><.value(3) "3">; this'll require reducing to something like `.value(Command("a3"))` or `.identifier("a3")` [or should that be .commandName("a3")? this reduction should probably be performed as CoreLexer]

//script = " “blah blah”"

//script = "3𝓍²＋5𝓎－1" // this requires some custom lexing (needs transformed to `(3 * x ^ 2) + (5 * y) + (1)`; of course, the real question is, once transformed, how to manipulate it symbolically?)

// scalars (atomic values) encapsulate boolean, integer, real, string, date, URL (née file), symbol; Q. which of these should appear as a single datatype? (e.g. numbers are really just degenerate strings, as are dates and URLs; if they look right, they should just work; OTOH, bools are rather awkward and we may prefer to adopt Icon-style success/failure or even kiwi-style empty/non-empty, while symbols must be syntactically distinct from strings to indicate semantic difference); also nothing (null), and possibly specialized did_nothing (c.f. Icon 'fail') for use in composable flow control expressions (e.g. for `TEST_EXPR else EXPR` where TEST_EXPR = `if BOOL EXPR`, multiple-test conditionals can be composed as `TEST_1 else TEST_2 else EXPR`)

// collections encapsulate ordered list (array), key-value list (dictionary), unique list (set)

// Q. what about structures? we can support records (ordered property sets, aka optionally labeled tuples) and/or [script] objects (encapsulated environment scopes); records offer one way to pass unary-command arguments, particularly if optional labels can be inferred by consumer (structural typing, pattern matching; esp if some form of multimethods is provided as alternative to traditional object encapsulation of single-dispatch OO; also bear in mind pattern-matched dispatch on multiple arguments fits far better with AEOM)

// complex values: commands, blocks (expression sequences); handlers (a composition of command-as-interface and expression [sequence], stored in an environment scope); what about identifiers/variables? or should we adopt entoli's everything-is-a-unary-command-that-takes-an-optional-argument instead, which may be conceptually cleaner and easier to explain as it describes everything as concrete behaviors rather than abstract name bindings? (we do need to consider single-assignment, non-maskable names, c.f. sylvia, as these are vital to predictable operator behavior given that operators are merely library-supplied syntactic sugar over library-defined commands)

// homoiconic; while it may lack Lisp’s extreme everything-is-a-list parsimony, all code is data and can be manipulated accordingly; in particular, a Shortcuts-style workflow is trivially encoded as an expression sequence, using pipeline operator when output of one command should be passed as first argument to the next

// handler interfaces must be fully introspectable; this includes parameter and result type constraints (Coercions) and errors throwable, user documentation, and metadata (keywords, categories, targets, etc); in additional to traditional text-based autosuggest, autocomplete, etc. interface introspection enables easy lightweight GUI form generation (auto-populating a window/panel with familiar GUI controls, labels, tooltips, etc into which an end-user can input arguments) and interactive voice input too: 3 UI modes for the price of 1

// chunk exprs? (aka “operator-precedence-is-a-pig-when-everything-is-a-unary-command-by-default”)

// possible block syntax[es]: comma-separated exprs, terminated by linebreak or period; `do…done`; `(…)`, `[…]`, `{…}`

// multi-word names must use underscores, not camelcase or other conventions, as those are easiest to parse as visual/spoken phrases (a code editor can reduce opacity of underscore chars to improve code readability without losing semantic clarity); true whitespace-in-identifiers (c.f. kiwi, entoli) is not desirable due to the tradeoffs that requires [and AppleScript-style parser “magic” is right out]
